<p>In deontology, whether something is right or wrong is based upon a set of morals or a code. The consequences do not matter, it’s the actions that count. Alternatively, in utilitarianism, one would base whether the action was good or bad based on the outcomes.</p>
<p>    Uber was founded in 2009 and has since swept through major cities around the world, disrupting the cab industry. It is seen as an easier, better way to commute around your city without dealing with cab companies, and in the process helping people just like you make a little extra cash. But while the idea of it seems good, the companies practices have raised a lot of concerns. </p>
<p>Beyond such, Uber doesn't care about the livelihood of its drivers. While the company boasts that its drivers can make up to 90k year. A journalist in Philadelphia who had worked for Uber for a few months found he was only making roughly 9 dollars an hour or 18k a year if he worked 40 hour weeks, not to mention it being 3.20$ below minimum wage. To make that boastful 90k a year at that rate of pay, one would have to work 27 and a half hours a day, 365 days a year. This is due to drivers being left with the bills for gas, repairs, and car maintenance. Uber takes a 20% cut and some additional fees from every ride, and while they used to pay their drivers enough to make 90k a year, they’ve been continually slashing pay for years. Additionally, Uber is incentivizing people to stop using public transportation in major cities; not only adding to major traffic congestions but to rising carbon emissions as well.  </p>
<p>Through the lens of a deontologist, Uber is seriously unethical. While the end result of easier and more convenient transportation is objectively a good thing, the actions Uber has taken to get there are seriously reprehensible through what we would consider societal norms or code. Taking into account the danger it poses for users, its treatment of its drivers, and its effects on local economies and the environment, using this app and its services cannot be considered ethically sound in a deontologists mind.  </p>
<p>From a utilitarians side, an argument could be made for Ubers platform. Despite the shady actions the company makes, the end goal is a large majority of people being happier using the app. There are roughly estimated to be 110 million users worldwide on the app, and a google play store rating of 4.2 / 5 and a 4.7 / 5 rating on the apple app store. Clearly, people are happy with the app and the service it provides. </p>
<p>At the end of the day, Uber isn’t going anywhere for a long time. It is up to the user to choose whether they side with deontology or utilitarianism when questioning the ethics of Uber.  </p>
